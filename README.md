#Url Builder 

##About
The project was built following the MVC pattern using PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap. It was created with the goal of simplifying the creation, storage, and export of URLs with UTM parameters.

##User Guide
Enter the desired destination URL in the 'URL' field and fill out the UTM parameters (source, medium, campaign, term, content) with relevant information to track the origin and performance of your links.
Afterward, you can list and export a CSV file containing all your created URLs.
